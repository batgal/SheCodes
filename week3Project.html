      Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy
      tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and
      Dave Arneson. It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules,
      Inc. (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a
      subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997. The game was derived from miniature
      wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the
      initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly recognized as the
      beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.
